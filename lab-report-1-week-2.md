You want to know how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6? Well, you've come to the right place! 
<br>
<br>
However, let's make sure you have the prerequisites to do this first.
<br>
## Installing VScode
Having Visual Studio Code (VScode) will likely make it more comfortable to work with remote servers as the course goes on. You'll have to install it eventually. So, let's do it now.
<br>
Go to VScode's [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and scroll down until you see the image below:

Choose the one you download based on your operating system. (Windows, Mac, Linux) 
<br>
<br>
Once it has finished downloading, run the installer. You can modify the settings as you like, but I suggest using the defaults if you're unsure.
<br>
<br>
When you're done with that, you should have an image that looks like this when you launch the application (but perhaps with a different GUI or main color based on your operating system):

<br>
## Remotely Connecting
Now that you have VScode up and running, let's make sure your computer and account are well prepared to connect to a remote server.
<br>
<br>
Firstly, you need to have access to your course-specific account for CSE15L. Go to this [website, which will allow you to lookup your cse15l account](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php), and enter your username and student ID.

<br>
<br>
Once you're in, you should see this page:

<br>
You see the "cs15lsp22aki" account? That's my course-specific account for cs15l, and how I connect to the remote server. Yours should be the same except for the last three letters, which will be replaced by yours, and perhaps "sp22" as well if you're reading this in a different quarter.
<br>
Make sure to change your password for this account if you haven't already, because otherwise, you will not be able to log in.
