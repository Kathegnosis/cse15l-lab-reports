You want to know how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6? Well, you've come to the right place! 
<br>
<br>
However, let's make sure you have the prerequisites to do this first.
<br>
## Installing VScode
Having Visual Studio Code (VScode) will likely make it more comfortable to work with remote servers as the course goes on. You'll have to install it eventually. So, let's do it now.
<br>
Go to VScode's [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and scroll down until you see the image below:

Choose the one you download based on your operating system. (Windows, Mac, Linux) 
<br>
<br>
Once it has finished downloading, run the installer. You can modify the settings as you like, but I suggest using the defaults if you're unsure.
<br>
<br>
When you're done with that, you should have an image that looks like this when you launch the application (but perhaps with a different GUI or main color based on your operating system):

<br>
It's time to connect to the server now.
